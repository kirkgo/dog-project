# Dog Project

Dog Project it's a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to process real-world images provided by users. Given an image of any dog, the algorithm can identify the dog's possible breed. If an image of a human is provided, the algorithm will identify which breed it looks like.

## Requirements

All requirements to run the application are available in the requirements.txt file. You will also need to download the VGG-16 file to train the neural network. You can download it using the link below:

Note: You will need to save the downloaded file inside the **bottleneck_features** folder.
